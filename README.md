# MODS-Project

## What is Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome? 
#### The Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is a development of potentially reversible physiologic derangement involving two or more organ systems. Alteration in organ function can vary widely from a mild degree of organ dysfunction to completely irreversible organ failure. The degree of organ dysfunction has a major clinical impact on the body.

## What are the causes of MODS?
#### MODS is induced by illness, injury or infection that triggers an unregulated systemic inflammatory response (known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome), resulting in tissue injury.
The most common trigger of MODS is sepsis. However, there are other various causes, including major trauma, major surgery, burns, shock, aspiration syndromes, blood transfusions, autoimmune disease, acute heart failure, poisons, and pancreatitis.

## About the Data
#### This study used data from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The dataset consisted of information about different types of cells in a total of 61 patients’ bodies. There were three different types of cells: T1, T2, and T3. T1 blood samples were collected within an hour after injury, T2 blood samples were collected between 4 hours to 12 hours, and T3 blood samples were collected between 48 hours to 72 hours after injury.
#### In the original data, there were 197 columns of information. However, about 10% of the information was incomplete. Therefore, for persistent and accurate analysis, about ⅔ of the original statistics was removed. The remaining 68 columns of information were complete and held promising data for use.
